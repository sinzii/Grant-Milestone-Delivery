# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The invoice has been send out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/use-inkubator/Support-Docs/blob/master/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**

**Application Document:** https://github.com/use-inkubator/Ecosystem-Grants/blob/master/applications/inkathon.md

## Context

We're happy to finally deliver a complete rewrite of the [inkathon Boilerplate](https://inkathon.xyz/) now supporting ink! v6 and much more as it includes:

1. ü¶ë A new **starterkit application**: https://inkathon.xyz
2. üìö A new **standalone documentation**: https://docs.inkathon.xyz
3. ‚öôÔ∏è A new **`create-inkathon-app`*** setup command: https://docs.inkathon.xyz/

New inkathon features:

- **Full ink! v6 support** with PolkaVM compatibility
- **Type-safe contract interactions** via PAPI
- **Modern stack**: Bun, Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Improved DX**: Better build- & deployment automation and contract management using Pop CLI
- **Production-ready**: Docker support, self-hosting optimized
- **New `create-inkathon-app` CLI** for setting up the boilerplate in seconds

### Note

\*The CLI **was not** part of the final application, but was included in our [first draft](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkubator-application/blob/2e5a4e6b5ba1e43b596b6401018c712580e28617/applications/inkathon.md#milestone-2-new-cli--alternative-client) which exceeded the available project budget. Nonetheless, we've decided to **build it proactively without compensation**, as it makes the setup experience 10x better and gets everyone started in seconds!

Also, after examining how to best approach the ink! v6-compatible rebuild, we came to the conclusion to discontinue `useInkathon` in favor of PAPI and ReactiveDOT. This is why the scope of Milestone 1 has slightly changed and now includes the new CLI and other adjustments that have a higher impact for inkathon compared to updating dependencies in a deprecated library. If required, we're still open to submit those, but we would rather use that time to further improve the boilerplate, documentation, and CLI with upcoming community feedback.
